This app contains jquery from bower and various web host packages in package.json, you can install both after you have cloned the repositories.

once you have the ying-and-yang you can install the prerequriasist with the following command in the terminal

```
npm install
```

> - build

this app needs mongoose to controll mongodb
when this is all installed you can start mongodb and mongo, open two new terminal tabs by pressing command + T twice and then on one type

```
mongod
```
and the other

```
mongo
```


> - run

To run the app you must have nodemon running as this creates the server on the local host and will update it every time you save, the best way to do this is on the first tab type in. Make sure you are in the ying-and-yang repositorie on your computer

```
npm run nodemon
```
